Phase A. Database Exploration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
  • Verify the structural integrity and scope of the primary dataset.
  • Confirm date range coverage and identify any gaps.
  • Assess completeness and validity of key fields.
  • Establish foundational statistics for subsequent analysis.

Phase A. Database Exploration Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- • Dataset contains 10,677,544 records spanning 8,886 distinct days from Jan 1, 2001 to April 30, 2025.
-- • Data quality is excellent: no null or negative values in key columns (rides, date, route_name).
-- • All major routes (e.g., 8A South Halsted, 152 Addison) have full daily records with stable distribution.
-- • Ridership ranges from 1 to 9999, with an average of ~5865 rides per entry and high variability (SD ≈ 6070).
